      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <section>
         Lose yourself for a day, a week, or forever on Magnetic Island.‘Maggie' is a charming holiday destination characterised by the fact that it is an island community with a resident population of over 2500. It's true what they say, the attraction truly is Magnetic.  Only 8 km from Townsville, Magnetic Island is only a 20 minute ferry ride from the mainland with SeaLink Queensland.

      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <section>
        The contrasting landscape of this Island makes this natural destination truly distinctive. The rocky granite headlands fuse with the 23 bays and beaches 
        (some of which are so isolated that they can only be accessed via foot or boat) studded with magnificent emerald green hoop pine trees, creating a dramatic coastline. Visible from the sea, Mount Cook hovers above the eucalypt woods and green vine forests with sheltered gullies of rainforest. A continental island composed mostly of granite, it was once part of the mainland before the sea level rose about 7500 years ago.

      <h3>Island History and Heritage</h3>
      <section>
        When Captain Cook discovered the island in 1770 he believed that it had a magnetic force causing interference with his compass. Subsequent tests disproved his theory but the name remains. The island's fascinating past is explained in interpretive signs located in Picnic, Cockle, Nelly, Arcadia, Horseshoe Bays and West Point. Visit the Magnetic Island History and Craft Centre in the old Picnic Bay School for more information about the island's heritage and to view a wonderful collection of old photographs and artifacts.

        <h3>Island Wildlife</h3>
      <section>
        With over 2/3 of the Island protected by National Park it is little wonder why there is an abundance of amazing wildlife and walks to discover. For birding enthusiasts Magnetic Island offers over 180 species of birds including colorful characters such as Kookaburras, Red-Tailed Black Cockatoos, Sulphur-Crested Cockatoos, Brahminy Kites and of course the Island's most iconic bird, the Bush Stone-Curlew  whose haunting, eerie sounds can be heard at night around the Island.

      <section>
      On land the graceful allied Rock Wallaby can be seen regularly on rocks near the edge of settlements such as the Geoffrey Bay jetty. Here you can hand feed the wallabies and fish that inhabit the local area. Look for koalas in trees around the island, particularly along the Forts walk. They rest motionless amongst eucalypt branches during the day and feed in the late afternoon. Listen for common brushtail possums at night as they feed on flowers, fruit and leaves.
